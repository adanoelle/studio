The error is not failure but resistance—a body that will not be parsed, a signal that refuses clarity.\n\nLegacy Russell writes that the glitch \"celebrates failure as a generative force.\" But what does it mean to fail on purpose? To make oneself unreadable?\n\nThe glitch is not chaos. It is a different order, one that the machine cannot process and therefore cannot contain."
