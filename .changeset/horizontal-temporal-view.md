feat(archive): add horizontal temporal view with queer temporality design

Implements a horizontal timeline view for the archive that resists vertical doomscroll patterns.
Items flow left-to-right (past to present) with soft year markers that create boundary and
liminality—acknowledging time's passage without insisting on hard edges.

Features:

- Horizontal continuous strip with cards sorted chronologically
- Floating year marker that updates as you scroll
- Soft year boundaries (subtle gradient separators)
- Year jump buttons in position indicator
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Home/End)
- Auto-scroll to present (right side) on view switch
- Fixed card dimensions (280x320px) centered vertically
- Responsive sizing for mobile and tablet
- Reduced motion support
